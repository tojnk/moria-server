; The list of player permissions.
; You should only modify this list when the server is closed.
; This list will be overwritten when players are blocked in-game.
; 
; Each line should be formatted like:
; name = Option,Option,Option
;
; Options Available:
;
; Blocked
; Will block a user with that account name.
; 
; Default
; Will use the default permissions.
; 
; NoConstruction
; Prevents user using any build or quickbuild functions, 
; or deconstructing any player constructions.
;
; QuickBuild
; Allows quick-build of platforms and rope ladders,
; but prevents other construction or deconstruction.
;
; name = AllConstruction
; Allows all construction and deconstruction.
;
; name = NoStorage
; Prevents interaction with storage containers, and
; disallows using shared base storage for crafting.
;
; name = AllStorage
; Allows all use of storage containers and contents.
;
; Example:
; Default = QuickBuild,NoStorage
; Durin = Blocked
; Gimli = AllConstruction,AllStorage
; Thorin = Default
;
; This sets default permissions for new players to allow quickbuilding,
; but prevents them from building other constructions or using storage.
; The user named Durin cannot join the server.
; The user named Gimli will have all permissions.
; The user named Thorin will have default permissions if they join.

Default = AllConstruction,AllStorage
